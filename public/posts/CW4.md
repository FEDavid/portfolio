## What do we mean by networking?

Networking is the term used to describe putting oneself out into the environment their field belongs to. It can differ greatly depending on your field, but in general describes things such as: events, meet-ups, job fairs, however not every type of networking takes place in person as these days there are other tools available such as LinkedIn. To me, the word means in a literal sense to insert yourself into the network of individuals who build up your profession and become one of them.

Through networking you will build up contacts who will be able to assist in guiding you or directing you towards others who may be able to instead, in some circumstances it may even lead to jobs or clients approaching you through word of mouth. Unfortunately I am quite old, and I can recall seeing a video on YouTube that comedically covers the very basics of networking - both in person, and the introduction to online networking.

## Why is networking important in the creative industries?

In the creative industries it is important to upkeep networking for multiple reasons in my opinion, with some being almost vital to succeed in your field;

- Reputation – Whether you choose to be a freelancer or work for a company you will require some description of reputation. Whether this be through word of mouth or testimonials you can present on social platforms, reputation can be the deciding factor on whether a client or employer chooses you to work with. Through networking you can build up reputation by showing off or discussing your work with other professionals in your field which has the potential to lead to job offers.

- Skill upkeep – In the creative industry you are extremely likely to deal with some form of technology, even if it's simply a case of dealing with others who will work with them directly. By networking with others through events or meet-ups, you can discuss upcoming technologies or ones you are not familiar with to gather hints, tips and techniques from other professionals to maintain your knowledge.

- Relationships – It's who you know - this is the principal part of networking. Having as many contacts as possible, whether it be to seek assistance, discuss work and projects, or ask for advice, is vital to succeed as you can have a large support network should you need it.


## Research your discipline area before you start networking – who is who in your field?

When it comes to networking, you need to consider researching your field before you start networking. Things such as companies you should be focusing to network with, people you may want to network with, and also developing technologies in your field. All of these will give you topics to discuss with people you meet or speak with online and will allow you to focus your networking for better success.

## Networking at events compared to networking online – how should you conduct yourself?

Whether it be online or through an in-person event, it is vital to maintain a professional standard in your behaviour. This is not to say you must be extremely stoic every second you are in person, as should you begin to get job offers, a large part of whether you get the job is if the employer feels you are a good fit for the team.

An important part of how you should present yourself comes from your knowledge, skills, and experience – confidence. While you are presenting work or discussing subjects within your field, you must maintain your confidence and professional nature. Unfortunately, should you go in seemingly unconfident in your field, you are unlikely to succeed. An old term of phrase once said, "Fake it till you make it".

## How do you get started?

To get started I would start with assuring you have a platform online where you have your details and portfolio work, a perfect example of this would be LinkedIn. You want to do this prior to in person networking, as any in person meeting will be limited by the amount of time you can speak with a person. Having your information and portfolio presented online means when you meet someone you wish to network with you can have a focused conversation about a specific topic and then you can simply provide a link to your platform (again whichever you choose) that holds all other relevant information.

Moving onto how you would pass on your information, I believe that the one size fits all answer of business cards is always a good approach, as once you've connected with someone in person it is a simple quick gesture to give the person your card. I feel like this also gives off a more professional approach as well, given that you look prepared to meet others – imagine you end up networking with someone and you end up having to rummage through your phone trying to pass your details on.

Once you have this setup, it's time to start attending some events – which there are a lot of. While you may be inclined to attend all events available, I believe it is best to find ones focused to your field as going to an event that is maybe too wide in scope may simply be a waste of time.
