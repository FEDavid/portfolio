# My Markdown Document

This is a sample Markdown document. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using plain text syntax.

## Heading 2

You can create headings using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.

### Heading 3

You can also create subheadings using additional `#` symbols.

- You can create bullet lists using `-`, `*`, or `+`.
- Lists can have multiple levels by indenting with spaces or tabs.

1. Numbered lists are created using numbers followed by a period.
2. Like bullet lists, numbered lists can also have multiple levels.

You can **bold** or *italicize* text using `**` or `*` respectively.

> Blockquotes are created using the `>` symbol. They are often used to highlight important information or quotes.

You can include inline code using backticks, like `console.log('Hello, World!');`.
