I have chosen to build my portfolio using a combination of two modern technologies: React and Tailwind. React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a seamless user experience is essential. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which can significantly speed up the development process and make the codebase more maintainable.
